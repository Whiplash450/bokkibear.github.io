Most settlements are fortified towns near the coast, and knightly orders are the only thing holding the darkness back.\n\nBernicia is currently ruled by none other [gallery:cersai-de-vries|Queen Cersei DeVries], Grandmaster of the Knights of the North, an order dedicated to [temple:Drako|Drako]. The rule of law and justice has therefore sunk deep into this otherwise land, leading to a renewed sense of binding purpose and fortitude in its people.

The wealthier lords of Essex hold a great deal of feudal influence and power in the form of the Essex Crown Council. The Kingdom is the centre of ship building industry and home of many Albion naval contingents, regardless of sponsoring nation. The people of Essex are seen as roguish and mercenary, yet respected for their talents. The relationship between Essex and [map:oxford|Oxford] has ever caused trouble, as the rougher and more practical nation compares itself to Oxford’s rigidity and aloofness... but also to its neighbour’s undeniable grandeur and courtly success. Essex is a heartland but equal parts in trade, farming and aggregate mining.\n\nRight now: the Queen is new to her throne, having been coronated in the Warhost during the Renewal of 1113. Originally of [map:wessex|Wessex], she is managing a divisive Essex Crown Council, an excitable surfeit of young, landless knights and the pressure of a populace still acclimatizing to her rule.\n\n**Essex Groups with the Warhost:** The Cambridge Brewers' Association, Arcane Tempest, Crew of the Santia Maria, Order of St. Eve",

			"description": "Elmet is a large but relatively impoverished region. Sheep farming, mining and logging are the main industries. The Kingdom is historically fortified against attacks from Cymrja. The population are proud and renowned for their resourcefulness in the face of adversity. This is a more backward area of Albion where many inhabitants tend to the traditional and eschew foreign and alien customs.\n\nThough King Gallad rules Elmet, he has been on a personal quest for some years and has not been heard of in some time. In his absence, the Seneschal of his house has been performing admirably but matters are starting to fray – the normally stable politics have picked up pace and the border with [map:anglia|Anglia] has become increasingly dangerous as that nation gradually expands its presence through armed patrols and reputed raiding.",

			"description": "Cornwall is an isolated and mountainous realm; wild moors separate it from the rest of Albion. The Kingdom was only recently civilized and properly settled. The coastal communities tend to be more in touch with civilization than the rustic interior shires. The old titles and positions still exist here, such as *thegn* and *shire-reeve*. Mining (especially tin) and fishing are the main industries. Cornwall is often referred to as the Battleground, especially in the areas around [map:battle-of-polgooth|Polgooth] which has seen multiple battles against the Keltoi and then the predations of the Eldest Druids. Cornishmen are often seen as backward and dour, still very barbaric/tribal in places – for example, witches and wisemen are known and valued rather than shunned; bread and milk are left on the hearth for nixies. Night time is a real threat in Cornwall, as it is then that the boggarts and other eldritch menaces come out. This is why most folk in the interior take shelter in caers (motte and bailey castles) come dusk.\n\nCornwall is at war with itself, with much of its populace held under the magical dominion of the Eldest Druids and their dark gods. A brave few fight a guerilla war against the swarming forces of darkness... but this is a war they are losing. Only two caers are known to hold out this time: Caer Culhaven in central Cornwall and Caer Dunaval on the east coast.\n\n**Groups of Cornwall with the Warhost:** Caer Culhaven, Monks of the Winding Chain ",

			"description": "Oxford is, by tradition, the seat of the rulers of Albion, though since the return of High King Tristian and his successors, this tradition has broken – to the anger and chagrin of the Crown Council of Oxford. The Council rule the Kingdom on behalf of Queen-in-Waiting Keira Trueheart until she comes of age. The Kingdom is widely considered the most civilised and cultured region of Albion, especially Oxford University, the eminent centre of learning. Oxford has strong links to the elven folk of Elvesham and the powers of magic; Keira often spends time with these eldritch folk. The population feel superior and often seen by outsiders as pompous.\n\nWith Keira still too young to rule, the normally extensive reach and power of Oxford has been curtailed since the days of the Trueheart rulers of Albion. While the lavish ceremonies and courtly traditions remain, there is no central figure to rein in the excesses of the nobility. In addition, folk are becoming concerned with the amount of time their Queen-in-Waiting is spending with the folk of Elvesham and the effect they may be having on her...",
